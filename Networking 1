Network ACL use case

Accessibility notes (optional).

The network ACL controls access to instances in a subnet and acts as a backup layer of defense. Network ACL rules apply to all instances in the subnet. 

In the example, instances in your subnet can communicate with each other and are accessible from a trusted remote computer. The remote computer might be a computer in your local network or an instance in a different subnet or VPC. You use it to connect to your instances to perform administrative tasks.

A Region contains one VPC with C I D R (cider) range 10.0.0.0/16. The VPC spans one Availability Zone (A Z) labeled Availability Zone 2. One public subnet with cider 10.0.1.0/24 is placed inside A Z 2. A security group box surrounds multiple instances. One line connects a client with IP 172.31.1.2/32 with the security group box. Another line connects to a description of security group sg-1a2b3c4d. Inbound, allow all traffic from sg-1a2b3c4d. Allow SSH traffic from 172.31.1.2/32. Outbound, allow all traffic from sg-1a2b3c4d. A box labeled ‘network acl-11223344’ is connected to A Z 2. Inbound, rule number 100. SSH 172.31.1.2/32 ALLOW. Rule number *. All traffic 0.0.0.0/0 DENY. Outbound, Rule number 100. Custom TCP 172.31.1.2/32 ALLOW. Rule number *. All traffic 0.0.0.0/0 DENY.

Your security group rules and network ACL rules allow access from the IP address of your remote computer (172.31.1.2/32). All other traffic from the internet or other networks is denied.
